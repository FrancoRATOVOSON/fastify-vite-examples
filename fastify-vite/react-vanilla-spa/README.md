# React Vanilla SPA

This is good if you already have an existing SPA made with vite.
You can almost simply copy your entire `src` folder inside the `client` folder.

As you can see by the way, this is the [react-ts](https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-znxvrq9r?terminal=dev) example, but we removed the `src` folder and put everything at the top level.
